# ansible-parts.horse

Ansible setup for setting up Parts Horse on FreeBSD.

## Assumptions

This setup assumes:

1. A DigitalOcean Droplet available running FreeBSD 12.
2. A domain that resolves to the IP for that system.

## Usage

In theory, all you need to do is this:

```
$ make <domain name or IP>
```
